# Predicting-Loan-Repayment - Small Dataset

The purpose of this project is to categorise loan applicants more accurately based on their ability to repay the loan. Moreover, it will look into the varaibles that may affect how quickly borrowers return their loans. Exploring some of the most well-known ML models will help achieve this. Finding patterns to employ on new loan takers can be done by using Machine Learning on data from prior loan borrowers. The Objective of this study is to compare the ML models that have been used in order to determine th ebest models for the data being utilised, as well as to make futire researchers job easier.

# Data Preprocessing

The dataset is taken from the kaggle. I have done preprocessing the dataset by identifing null values from the columns in the dataset, Out of all the columns which have null values, I have picked credit_history column and loan_amount column, as they are important parameters to be considered. Then, I replaced the null values of these two columns based on the skewness of the data and replace mean value for the null values of loan_amount and median value for the null values of credit_history column.

# Exploratory Data Analysis

Here, I have seen the distribution of loan_status for entire dataset where 69% of the people are repaying their loan and 31% are not. Then I made visualization for all the features with respective loan status, to get some better idea of the data and then I prepared the correlation matrix for all the features and observed that the credit_history has high correlation with the loan_status.

# Prediction Based on ML Algorithms

The algorithms which I have used for this classification problem are 

1. Logistic Regression accuracy is 0.80
2. Decision Tree Accuracy is 0.70
3. Random Forest Accuracy is 0.77
4. KNN Accuracy is 0.73
5. SVC Accuracy is 0.70

# Conclusion
The Loan Status is highly dependent on Credit History for Predcitons. The Logistic Regression algorithm gives us the maximum Accuracy (80%) compared to other ML Algorithms.
